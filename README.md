# Baduck
Baduck.lua is a program you can use to play Baduck, my variant of weiqi.

rules can be found in the Baduck.txt file

NOTE: Pay attention to whose Turn it is! If the same Player comes up twice, that's because they made an illegal or invalid move, and they must enter a legal one! Remember that Passing is always legal!

NOTE 2: Komi should be written as a decimal. That means that "6.5" is good, but "six and a half", "six point five", and "6 and 1/2" are not good and will result in the program defaulting to a Komi of 7.5. Komi minus 1/2 should always be an integer!

NOTE 3: You need Lua installed to play this! You can download it at https://www.lua.org/download.html.
